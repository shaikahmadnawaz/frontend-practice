# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Object:** A collection of properties and methods.
- **toLowerCase:** A method used to convert text to lowercase.

## Why Use OOP?

- To organize code more effectively.
- To model real-world entities and their interactions.

## Parts of OOP

- **Object Literal:** A simple way to create objects.
- **Constructor Function:** A blueprint for creating objects.
- **Prototypes:** Mechanism for object inheritance.
- **Classes:** A modern way to define object blueprints.
- **Instances (new, this):** Creation and referencing of objects.

## The 4 Pillars of OOP

1. **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors.
2. **Encapsulation:** Hiding the internal details of an object and providing a controlled interface.
3. **Inheritance:** Allowing a class (subclass/derived) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass/base).
4. **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects to take on multiple forms and respond to messages in unique ways.
