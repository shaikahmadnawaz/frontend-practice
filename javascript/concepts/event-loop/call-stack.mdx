# Call Stack

In JavaScript, the **call stack** is a mechanism used to manage the execution of functions. It operates in a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** manner, meaning the most recent function called gets executed first. When a function is invoked, it's added to the top of the stack. Once the function completes, it's removed from the stack, and the control moves back to the next function down.

Here's a simplified process:

1. **Function call**: When a function is called, it gets pushed onto the stack.
2. **Execution**: The engine executes the function.
3. **Completion**: Once finished, the function is popped off the stack.
4. **Error**: If the stack grows too large due to too many function calls (e.g., infinite recursion), it results in a "stack overflow" error.

The call stack is crucial in handling **synchronous** operations in JavaScript, as it ensures that functions are executed in order and that the current function completes before moving on to the next.
